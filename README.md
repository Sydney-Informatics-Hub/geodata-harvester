The Geodata-Harvester package offers reusable and automated workflows for data extraction from a wide range of geospatial and environmental data sources. User provided data is auto-completed with a suitable set of spatial- and temporal-aligned covariates as a ready-made dataset for machine learning and environmental models. In addition, all requested data layer maps are automatically extracted and aligned for a specific region and time period.

## Introduction

There is an enormous amount of national/global space-time data that is free and accessible. Examples are the numerous satellite platforms, weather, soil landscape grid of Australia. Many have a temporal dimension so for any point in Australia you can extract a time series of remote sensing and weather data and soil and terrain site variables. In the case of time series covariates there are a number of post-processing steps that a user can undertake to extract meaning, e.g. temporal means, aggregating in time. All of the above is a non-trivial task and a workflow where a user could enter a point (s) and get a tidy data frame of data cube variables would be a step towards people understanding its value and being able to jumpstart their analysis. This project will contribute processing tools for finding, extracting and converting these key data layers.

Developed as part of the Agricultural Research Federation (AgReFed), Geodata-Harvester is an open-source software that allows users to jumpstart their analysis with a suitable set of spatial-temporal aligned raster maps and dataframes.

## Data Sources

A detailed list of all available layers and their description can be found in [Data Overview](quarto/docs/Data_Overview.md).

The following main data sources are currently implemented:

- Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA)
- SILO Climate Database
- National Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 1 Second Hydrologically Enforced
- Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Geoscience Earth Observations
- GSKY Data Server for DEA Geoscience Earth Observations
- Radiometric Data
- Google Earth Engine Data (GEE account needed), see for overview [Earth_Engine_Data_Overview](quarto/docs/Earth_Engine_Data_Overview.md).

## Functionality

The main goal of the Data Harvester is to enable researchers with reusable workflows for automatic data extraction and processing:

1. Retrieve: given set of locations, automatically access and download multiple data sources (APIs) from a diverse range of geospatial and soil data sources
2. Process: Spatial and temporal processing, conversion to dataframes and custom raster-files
3. Output: Ready-made dataset for machine learning (training set and prediction mapping)

Geodata-Harvester is designed as a modular and maintainable project in the form of a multi-stage pipeline by providing explicit boundaries among tasks. To encourage interaction and experimentation with the pipeline, multiple frontend notebooks and use case scenarios are provided.

## Key Features

Below is a list of features available for the geodata-harvester package. Please check the project Github webpage and notebooks for examples, data selection, and other settings.

- automatic data retrieval from geodata APIs for given locations and dates
- automatic download and spatial-temporal processing of geo-spatial maps for user-specified bounding box, resolution, and time-scale.
- support for multiple temporal aggregation options and spatial-temporal buffer
- automatic extraction of retrieved data into ready-made dataframes for ML training
- automatic generation of ready-made aligned maps and data for ML prediction models
- visualisation of downloaded and aligned maps
- support for saving and loading settings via interactive widgets
- batch processing and reusable workflows via yaml settings files
- with connectivity support to the Google Earth Engine API, perform petabyte-scale operations which include temporal cloud/shadow masking and automatic calculation of spectral indices

## Installation

Geodata-Harvester can be run on cloud-servers (e.g., in JupyterHub environment) or on your local machine. If you like to install Data Harvester locally, it is recommended to setup a virtual environment for the installation, e.g., via conda miniforge (see for dependencies `environment.yaml`).

To install in a new conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml -n <ENV_NAME>
conda activate <ENV_NAME>
```
or to update an existing conda environment:
```bash
conda env update -f environment.yaml 
```

### Pip install

Installation via pypi requires a pre-installation of gdal (see, e.g., [pypi.org/project/GDAL/installation guide](https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/)) in your environment. Once gdal is installed, you can install geodata-harvester via

```bash
pip install geodata-harvester
```
The geodata-harvester library can then be imported via

```Python
import geodata_harvester
```

Example notebooks can be found in the folder [notebooks](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks).

## How to get started

1. Options and user settings are defined by the user in the settings; see for settings documentation [Settings_Overview](quarto/docs/Settings_Overview.md)

2. Run the jupyter notebook in the folder [notebooks](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks).
