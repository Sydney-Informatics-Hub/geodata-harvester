## üí° Introduction

There is an enormous amount of national/global space-time data that is free and accessible. Examples are the numerous satellite platforms, weather, soil landscape grid of Australia. Many have a temporal dimension so for any point in Australia you can extract a time series of remote sensing and weather data and soil and terrain site variables. In the case of time series covariates there are a number of post-processing steps that a user can undertake to extract meaning, e.g. temporal means, aggregating in time. All of the above is a non-trivial task and a workflow where a user could enter a point (s) and get a tidy data frame of data cube variables would be a step towards people understanding its value and being able to jumpstart their analysis. This project will contribute processing tools for finding, extracting and converting these key data layers.

Developed as part of the Agricultural Research Federation (AgReFed), Geodata-Harvester is an open-source software that allows users to jumpstart their analysis with a suitable set of spatial-temporal aligned raster maps and dataframes.

## üåç Data Sources

A detailed list of all available layers and their description can be found in [Data Overview](quarto/docs/Data_Overview.md).

The following main data sources are currently implemented:

- Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA)
- SILO Climate Database
- National Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 1 Second Hydrologically Enforced
- Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Geoscience Earth Observations
- GSKY Data Server for DEA Geoscience Earth Observations
- Radiometric Data
- Google Earth Engine Data (GEE account needed), see for overview [Earth_Engine_Data_Overview](quarto/docs/Earth_Engine_Data_Overview.md).

## üîÑ Functionality

The main goal of the Data Harvester is to enable researchers with reusable workflows for automatic data extraction and processing:

1. Retrieve: given set of locations, automatically access and download multiple data sources (APIs) from a diverse range of geospatial and soil data sources
2. Process: Spatial and temporal processing, conversion to dataframes and custom raster-files
3. Output: Ready-made dataset for machine learning (training set and prediction mapping)

Geodata-Harvester is designed as a modular and maintainable project in the form of a multi-stage pipeline by providing explicit boundaries among tasks. To encourage interaction and experimentation with the pipeline, multiple frontend notebooks and use case scenarios are provided.

## üåü Key Features

The geodata-harvester package provides the following core features:

- enabling reproducible workflows via YAML settings files (see for settings example [settings_harvest.yaml](notebooks/settings/settings_harvest.yaml)).
- interactive widgets for settings selection (see for example notebook [example_harvest_with_widgets.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest_with_widgets.ipynb)).
- automated download and processing pipeline for multiple data sources (supported by the `harvest.run()` function as demonstrated in the example notebook [example_harvest.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest.ipynb)).
- automatic data retrieval from geodata APIs and spatiotemporal processing for given locations, bounding box, resoultion, and time-scales into ready-made aligned and geo-referenced maps in GeoTiff format (see [notebook API download and process step](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/blob/main/notebooks/example_harvest_stepwise.ipynb#Download-and-process-data-from-API-sources)).
- support for time-series data extraction for multiple time slices (see example notebook [example_harvest_temporal1.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest_temporal1.ipynb) and [example_harvest_temporal2.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest_temporal2.ipynb)). 
- automatic extraction of retrieved data into ready-made dataframes for ML training ([see notebook point extraction process](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/blob/main/notebooks/example_harvest_stepwise.ipynb#Points-extraction-from-downloaded/processed-data))).
- preview of downloaded and aligned maps (see [notebook preview example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/blob/main/notebooks/example_harvest_stepwise.ipynb#Overview-plot-of-all-processed-rasters)).
- with connectivity support to the Google Earth Engine API, perform petabyte-scale operations which include temporal cloud/shadow masking and automatic calculation of spectral indices (see pipeline notebook [example_harvest_withGEE.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest_withGEE.ipynb)) or the [step-by-step GEE process instructions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/blob/main/notebooks/example_harvest_stepwise.ipynb#Google-Earth-Engine).

For more details about all functionalities, please consult the [API reference documentation](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/geodata-harvester/API/geodata_harvester/index.html).

## üîß Installation

Geodata-Harvester can be run on cloud-servers (e.g., in JupyterHub environment) or on your local machine. 
Example notebooks for importing and using the package can be found in the folder [notebooks](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks). The package can be installed via PyPI or Conda:

### Conda or Mamba

The package geodata-harvester is available via the conda-forge channel:

```bash
conda install geodata-harvester -c conda-forge
```

Note that the geodata-harvester is imported with underscore as 

```Python
import geodata_harvester
```

### PyPI

Installation via PyPI requires a pre-installation of gdal (see, e.g., [pypi.org/project/GDAL/installation guide](https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/)) in your environment. Once gdal is installed, you can install geodata-harvester via

```bash
pip install geodata-harvester
```
The geodata-harvester library can then be imported via

```Python
import geodata_harvester
```

### Google Earth Engine extension

Optionally you can include Google Earth Engine (GEE) data in Geodata-Harvester (see [Settings_Overview](quarto/docs/Settings_Overview.md)).
GEE requires a Google account and a GEE authorization. If this is your first time using GEE, please follow [these instructions](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/) and authorise Geodata-Harvester to use the Google Earth Engine API. See a preview of the process [here](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/AgReFed-Workshop/pydocs/setup-gee.html#part-ii-authorising-your-workstation-with-gee).

NOTE: You only have to perform this authorisation ONCE. Or at least you only have to do it once per ‚Äúconnection‚Äù or if you use an incognito window.  


### Local development

If you like to develop Data Harvester locally, it is recommended to setup a virtual environment for the installation, e.g., via conda miniforge (see for dependencies `environment.yaml`) and to fork the Geodata-harvester repo. To install only the latest development version use:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester
```

### Workshop Cloud Sandbox

As play-ground for workshop training sessions and testing of the Geodata-Harvester we provide a pre-installed cloud Python Jupyterlab environment, which does not require any local installation. For login instructions and how to access the sandbox, please visit our [Python workshop page](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/AgReFed-Workshop/pydocs/py00-workshop.html).

The Jupyter environment is hosted on the ARDC Nectar Research Cloud in partnership with AgReFed and Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). Note that this sandbox is currently hosted for test purposes only and generated data is not permanently stored.

The Geodata-Harvester can be easily installed also on other cloud services (e.g., Google Colab, Azure Notebooks).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Overview

The Geodata-Harvester is controlled by a settings file in YAML format. The settings file contains all user-defined settings for the data extraction and processing. A detailed settings overview is provided in [Settings_Overview](quarto/docs/Settings_Overview.md). Example settings files are provided along the notebooks in the folder [notebooks/settings](notebooks/settings).  

Alternatively a settings file can be also created via the interactive widget-panels as demonstrated in the notebook [example_harvest_with_widgets.ipynb](notebooks/example_harvest_with_widgets.ipynb).


## üöÄ How to get started

You may now invoke the geodata-harvester directly from a python terminal with:

```python
import geodata_harvester as gdh
gdh.harvest.run(PATH_TO_SETTINGS_YAMLFILE)
```

**Note the subtle but important difference in use of an underscore `_` to import the package and the use of a dash `-` to install it!**

To get started, some example workflows are provided as Jupyter notebooks:

1. Clone the geodata-harvester repo to your local machine or cloud server. Alternatively, download the package as zip folder from the [geodata-harvester Github page](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the folder. This will download the geodata-harvester package including the example notebooks, settings files and example input data.

2. Options and user settings are defined by the user in the settings; see for example settings file [settings_harvest.yaml](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/settings/settings_harvest.yaml)

3. Run a jupyter notebook in the notebooks folder, such as  [example_harvest.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest.ipynb).

4. The notebook will run the geodata-harvester with the settings file and download/process all the requested data. The final data is saved in the folder `results_example_harvest` in the current working directory as specified in the settings file. There you can find the generated data table `results.csv` and the downloaded georeferenced .tif files (open with, e.g., rasterio, QGIS or ArcGIS). A summary of all generated images is provided in the table `download_summary.csv`.

A step-by-step tutorial on how to use the individual modules of the Geodata-Harvester is provided in the notebook [example_harvest_stepwise.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest_stepwise.ipynb).

To include Google Earth Engine (GEE) data in Geodata-Harvester, please follow the instructions in the notebook [example_harvest_withGEE.ipynb](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/notebooks/example_harvest_withGEE.ipynb). Note that this requires a GEE account and authorisation (see [Google Earth Engine extension](#google-earth-engine-extension)).

If you would like to learn more about the Geodata-Harvester, please also visit our [Workshop webpage](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/AgReFed-Workshop/).

## ‚úÖ Testing

Test functions are included in the [tests](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geodata-harvester/tree/main/tests) folder. Note that due to the nature of this package, these tests require an internet connection and may fail if the data source API servers are not available or the data source API has changed. To run automated tests with `pytest`, you need to install the package with
```bash
pip install pytest
```
and then run:
```bash
cd tests
pytest ./
```
or test individual modules with, e.g.,
```bash
cd tests
pytest test_getdata_dea.py
```


## ‚ûï How to add new data source modules

The Geodata-Harvester is designed to be extendable and new data source modules can be added as Python modules (for examples, see `getdata_*.py` modules). If you would like to add a new data source, please follow the [adding new data source guidelines](quarto/docs/How_to_add_DataSources.md)  

We recommend to fork the geodata-harvester repo and develop new modules in a local environment. If you would like to contribute your data source module to the geodata-harvester package, please visit the [geodata-harvester contribution guidelines](quarto/docs/Contributing.md).
