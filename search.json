    "text": "Functionality\nThe main goal of the Data Harvester is to enable researchers with reusable workflows for automatic data extraction and processing:\n\nRetrieve: automatically access geospatial and soil data sources, minimal handling of individual APIs\nProcess: Spatial and temporal processing, filter, mask, reduce and convert data\nOutput: download data as GeoTIFF and ready-made data frames for use in additional modelling and machine learning workflows\n\nData-Harvester is designed as a modular and maintainable project in the form of a multi-stage pipeline by providing explicit boundaries among tasks. To encourage interaction and experimentation with the pipeline, we provide multiple frontend notebooks and use case scenarios as Jupyter and R notebooks, as well as standalone Python and R packages. The core features are:\n\nautomatic data retrieval from geospatial APIs for given locations and dates\ndata experimentation frontends via Jupyter and R notebooks\nenables reusable workflows via interactive widgets and YAML files to save/load settings.\nautomatic geospatial-temporal processing\nsupport for multiple temporal aggregation options\nautomatic extraction of retrieved data into ready-made dataframes for ML training\nautomatic generation of ready-made aligned maps and dataframes for ML prediction models\npreview of data map layers"

Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery captured over the Australian continent and corrects for inconsistencies across land and coastal fringes. This product has been corrected to remove the influences of the atmosphere, the time of year, terrain shadow and satellite view angles. Some of the layers include image composites that are made from images acquired within a 16 day period.\nModule name: getdata_dea_nci.py\nResolution: variable (typically 1 arcsec)\nUpdates: daily to yearly\nSource: https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Datasets\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nAttribution: The data products are produced using Digital Earth Australia.

This service combines terrain corrected surface reflectance observations from three Landsat sensors (Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI) and two Sentinel 2 sensors (Sentinel 2A and 2B). More detailed information about the terrain corrected surface reflectance product suite produced using Digital Earth Australia including CCBY4.0 is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/25/5a7a76d2e129e. The service for each day is composed from all acquisitions that occurred over the Australian region on that calendar day.\n\n‘hltc_high’ :\n\ntitle: DEA High Tide Composite 25m v2.0\ndescription: The High and Low Tide Composites product is composed of two surface reflectance composite mosaics of Landsat TM and ETM+ (Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 respectively) and OLI (Landsat 8) surface reflectance data Li et al. 2010 https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2042281. These products have been produced using Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The two mosaics allow cloud free and noise reduced visualisation of the shallow water and inter-tidal coastal regions of Australia, as observed at high and low tide respectively. The composites are generated utilising the geomedian approach of Roberts et al. (2017) (https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2723896) to ensure a valid surface reflectance spectra suitable for uses such as habitat mapping. The time range used for composite generation in each polygon of the mosaic is tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated (see Sagar et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10030480)). The concepts of the Observed Tidal Range (OTR), and Highest and Lowest Observed Tide (HOT, LOT) are discussed and described fully in Sagar et al. (2017) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.04.009). This service provides access to the High Tide Composite v2.0 product.

ITEM provides the extent and topography of the intertidal zone of Australia’s coastline (excluding offshore Territories). This information was derived using observations in the Landsat archive since 1986. ITEM v2.0 has implemented an improved tidal modelling framework over that utilised in ITEM v1.0 (Sagar et al. 2017, 2018) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.04.009, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10030480). The expanded Landsat archive within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) has also enabled the model extent to be increased from ITEM v1.0 to cover a number of offshore reefs, including the full Great Barrier Reef and southern sections of the Torres Strait Islands. ITEM can be a valuable complementary dataset to both onshore LiDAR survey data and coarser offshore bathymetry data, enabling a more realistic representation of the land and ocean interface. More detailed information including CCBY4.0 is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/25/5a602cc9eb358. This service provides access to the Intertidal Extents Model v2.0 Relative Layer product. The relative layer displays the modelled extents of the exposed intertidal zone, at percentile intervals of the observed tidal range (OTR). For example, the region defined as 0-10% denotes an area that only exposes at the lowest 10% of tides in relation to the OTR.\n\n‘item_stddev’ :\n\ntitle: DEA Intertidal Extents Model Confidence Layer 25m v2.0\ndescription: The Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM) product is a national dataset characterising the spatial extents of the exposed intertidal zone; the land between the observed highest and lowest tide, at intervals of the observed tidal range.

ITEM v2.0 has implemented an improved tidal modelling framework over that utilised in ITEM v1.0 (Sagar et al. 2017, 2018) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.04.009, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10030480). The expanded Landsat archive within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) has also enabled the model extent to be increased from ITEM v1.0 to cover a number of offshore reefs, including the full Great Barrier Reef and southern sections of the Torres Strait Islands. ITEM can be a valuable complementary dataset to both onshore LiDAR survey data and coarser offshore bathymetry data, enabling a more realistic representation of the land and ocean interface. More detailed information including CCBY4.0 is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/25/5a602cc9eb358. This service provides access to the Intertidal Extents Model v2.0 Confidence Layer product. The confidence layer displays the standard deviation of the water index values (NDWI) derived across the tidal intervals used in generating the core ITEM relative extents product. High values indicate regions where inundation patterns are not driven by tidal influences. This can be a result of change (shoreline, geomorphic, anthropogenic), or caused by errors in the underlying tidal model.\n\n‘landsat5_nbar_16day’ :\n\ntitle: 16-day DEA Landsat 5 surface reflectance\ndescription: This product has been corrected to remove the influences of the atmosphere, the time of year and satellite view angles using the methods described in Li et al. 2010 https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2042281.

The individual survey datasets have been acquired by Geoscience Australia and its State and Territory Government partners. The compilations of radiometric data involved the levelling and merging (mosaicking) of regularly interpolated grid (raster) data, from selected individual geophysical surveys, into near-seamless national scale grids for each datatype and creating derivations thereof. The selected individual surveys are chosen based on the spatial resolution and accuracy of individual surveys within a given area.\nModule name: getdata_radiometric.py\nResolution: 100m (0.001 deg)\nUpdates: None\nSource: https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Datasets,\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nAttribution: Geoscience Australia.

A YAML file is a Unicode based language and is designed for human interaction and to work well with modern programming languages, and is typically used for configuration settings and reusable workflows. YAML uses the .yaml extension (alternatively .yml) for its files. Its syntax is independent of a specific programming language.\nTemplates for the .yaml settings file are provided in the folder settings. More information about YAML Syntax can be found here.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, settings can be selected in the interactive widget of the Jupyter Notebook, which also automatically saves all settings for a run in a .yaml file as well. The interactive widgets are powered by ipywidgets and are currently supported for the Jupyter Notebooks. The widget also allows the user to load a saved .yaml file.\nNote for developers: To make changes to the functionality of the widgets (e.g, extending with new settings or options), please see the script harvesterwidgets.py in the folder widgets.\n\n\n\nThe settings file can be validated and checked for correct options (e.g. valid schema, data types, and data ranges) via the function validate in validate_settings.py, e.g.:\nfname_settings = 'settings_v0.3.yaml'\nimport validate_settings\nvalidate_settings.validate(fname_settings)\nNote for developers: Please update validate_settings.py and version if new data layers or options are added to the Data-Harvester.\n\n\n\nThe input file name is specified in infile and is a .csv file that and must include at least point coordinates. The Data Harvester will download new data for these coordinates and align with any given data in the input file. Th column names for the latitude and longitude coordinates are selected by the settings colname_lat and colname_lng, respectively.\nAll data results and images will be saved in the output directory as specified in the settings outpath.\nExample:\n#Input File:\ninfile: ../testdata/Pointdata_Llara.csv\n\n#Output Path:\noutpath: ../../dataresults/\n\n#Headername of Latitude in input file:\ncolname_lat: Lat\n\n#Headername of Longitude in input file:\ncolname_lng: Long\n\n\n\nThe spatial extent of the requested images can be given as bounding box list in the settings target_bbox, in the order: lng_min, lat_min, lng_max, lat_max (left, bottom, right, top corner of box). If no bounding box is provided, Data-Harvetser will automatically infer a padded bounding box based on the extent of the coordinates given in the input file.\nThe spatial resolution of the requested images is specified in target_res and given in arcsec (1 arcsec corresponds to roughly 30m on the Equator, please see arc2meter.pyfor calculating exact conversion of meter to arcsec and vice versa).\nThe years for the requested data is specified via target_dates and can be one specific year or a list of multiple years.\nTBD: - The temporal resolution specifies the length of the time (in days) for which data is aggregated. The date range will then be subdivided in n bins = maximum year - minimum year divided by temporal resolution - Spatial buffer\nExample:\n#Bounding Box as (lng_min, lat_min, lng_max, lat_max):\ntarget_bbox: ''\n\n#Select years:\ntarget_dates:\n  - 2021\n\n#Spatial Resolution [in arcsec]:\ntarget_res: 6.0\n\n#Temporal Resolution [in days, from 1 to 365 days], TBD\ntemp_res: 365\n\n\n\nThe requested layers are specified in the settings target_sources.

    "text": "There is an enormous amount of national/global space-time data that is free and accessible. Examples are the numerous satellite platforms, weather, soil landscape grid of Australia. Many have a temporal dimension so for any point in Australia you can extract a time series of remote sensing and weather data and soil and terrain site variables. In the case of time series covariates there are a number of post-processing steps that a user can undertake to extract meaning, e.g. temporal means, aggregating in time. All of the above is a non-trivial task and a workflow where a user could enter a point (s) and get a tidy data frame of data cube variables would be a step towards people understanding its value and being able to jumpstart their analysis. This project will contribute processing tools for finding, extracting and converting these key data layers.\nDeveloped as part of the Agricultural Research Federation (AgReFed), Data-Harvester is an open-source software that allows users to jumpstart their analysis with a suitable set of spatial-temporal aligned raster maps and dataframes.\nFor more information about AgReFed and our shared mission, please see agrefed.org.au/"
